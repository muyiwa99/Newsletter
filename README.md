## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS: CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a good challenge to help me gain a better understanding of form validation, specifically an email input. I learnt how to name and target the correct elements and was successfully able to manipulate them how i wanted. This also gave me an opportunity to implement an if statement with various conditions, use of multiple functions and event listeners for buttons.

### Continued development

Going forward i want to learn more complex ways to implement various form validation for different input elements; password, first and last name, Card number, password match and the error messages or states that come with them
